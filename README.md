RF Exposure Calculator - Helping hams understand the mysteries of RF Exposure

Copyright Â© 2009-2023 Vernon Mauery (N7OH)

The idea originated from the power density calculator written by W4/VP9KF. I
started writing my own javascript version only to find that it was really
annoying to need to retype everything in each time I visited the page. I wanted
something that would store my data. And I wanted to be able to share the
application with others, but I didn't want to store their information. I
finally learned about local storage with HTML 5 and decided that I could use
that for this application.
