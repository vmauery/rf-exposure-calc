	<p>Sorry for the inconvenience. The N7OH RFE Calculator requires just about
	anything except Internet Explorer.  Try <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">
	FireFox</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a>,
	<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>, or maybe even
	Safari.  Whatever you try, make sure it is a new browser that supports HTML 5.

	The idea originated from the <a
	href='http://hintlink.com/power_density.htm'>power density calculator
	written by W4/VP9KF</a>.
	I started writing my own javascript version only to find that it was
	really annoying to need to retype everything in each time I visited
	the page.  I wanted something that would store my data.  And I wanted
	to be able to share the application with others, but I didn't want to
	store <i>their</i> information.  I finally learned about local storage
	with HTML 5 and decided that I could use that for this application.
